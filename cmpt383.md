### Topic idea: 
Implement image compression algorithm on a front-end and back-end interactive website applicationï¼Œ I will use react framework as front-end server and Django framework as back-end server


### programming language: 
    Javascript: used in the frond-end, used to read .bmp fild uploaded locally and image array and length and width of the image to the backend
    Python: used in the Django frameword, used to build a back-end server, receive data from the front-end and calculate the result
    c++: used to write the main image-comression algorithm

### two inter-language communication methods:
    Foreign function interface: between c++ and python
    REST APIs: between Javascript and Python

### Deployment technology: Vagrant VM
